config GPIO_INTEL_MSIC
	bool "Intel MSIC GPIO support"
	depends on INTEL_SCU_IPC && GPIOLIB
	---help---
	  MSIC provides a GPIO subsystem containing several input
	  output pins.
	  Say Y here to support GPIO via the SCU IPC interface
	  on Intel MID platforms.

config INTEL_MID_OSNIB_ILB
        tristate "cmos osnib driver for Intel BYT platforms"
        default n
        ---help---
			This driver adds OSNIB support using CMOS.
			OSNIB is used to share flags between firmware and kernel.
			This is only valid when no SCU is present.

			If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_MID_OSIP
	tristate "osip driver for Intel MID platforms"
	depends on INTEL_SCU_IPC
	default y
	help
	  This driver modifies the osip header when rebooting,
	  so that one can type 'reboot bootloader' to fall back
	  in kboot mode.

	  If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_MID_OSIP_DEBUG_FS
	tristate "osip driver debug fs"
	depends on INTEL_MID_OSIP && DEBUG_FS
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds debugfs interface.
	  The main feature of that interface is to be able to modify the kernel
	  cmdline directly in the OSIP.
	  This has to be disabled if we have secure boot enabled by default.

	  If unsure, say N.
